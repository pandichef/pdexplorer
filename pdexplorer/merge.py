    From the stata manual:
    Because m:m merges are such a bad idea, we are not going to show you an example. If you think
    that you need an m:m merge, then you probably need to work with your data so that you can use a
    1:m or m:1 merge.

    By default, merge treats values from the master as inviolable. When observations match, it is the
    masterâ€™s values of the overlapping variables that are recorded in the merged result.

    If you specify the update option, however, then all missing values of overlapping variables in
    matched observations are replaced with values from the using data. Because of this new behavior,
    the merge codes change somewhat. Codes 1 and 2 keep their old meaning. Code 3 splits into codes
    3, 4, and 5. Codes 3, 4, and 5 are filtered according to the following rules; the first applicable rule
    is used.
