`ml/` is where classical machine learning algorithms reside, typically using `scikit-learn`.

Stata doesn't typically develop such techniques as its focus is Econometrics.

Classical machine learning algorithms (as opposed to deep learning) typically involve training
on a complete, and relatively small, dataset.
